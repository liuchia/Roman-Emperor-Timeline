### Synopsis

This is an interactive timeline of the rulers of the Roman Empire, stretching from the creation of the empire under Augustus in 27BC up to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Laskarid Dynasty of the Nicene Empire fills the brief hole after the the Crusaders sacked Constantinople in 1204. The x-axis of the graph represents time, which is separated with 10 year intervals, and the y-axis just highlights the number of rulers the Romans had in the corresponding year. Time can be traversed via dragging the chart and the names and dynasties of all emperors of a year is displayed with tooltips when the cursor is within the timeline. The Dynasty or the general period an emperor (or empress) belonged is colour-coded - visually separating the progression of the empire.

Another feature I added to the timeline was the ability to filter people by their fate - whether they abdicated, were assassinated, deposed, etc.
